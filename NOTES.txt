To run the above JavaScript code from the Linux command line, you can use Node.js. Here's how:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y

Verify the installation:
node -v
npm -v

Node.js doesnâ€™t have fetch built-in for CLI scripts. Install the node-fetch library:
npm install node-fetch


Run the script with a shortened URL as an argument:
node nodeapp.js https://tinyurl.com/nhbds76x
